# Project Glimpse 
Project Glimpse is a Facial Rekognition platform for local places that currently utilize outdated systems like ID card, Fingerprint, and passcode. Instead the system just simply needs to see your face for one second to be able to see an employee and clock them in.

This repository hosts the glimpse backend sourcecode which utilizes Amazon AWS Lambda, API Gateway, RDS, and Rekognition for facial recognition.
